            <p>My full name is Valeria Catalina Szymanski Gomez, and I was born and raised in Jalisco, Mexico. I moved to the United States about six years ago. I work as manager at a candy store. My major in college is Computer Engineering, and I am almost done with general ed. I am currently taking a wed development program at UCSD extensions. I want to transfer to SDSU or UCSD. I am a beginner coder. My goal is to work freelance or home office because I love being home. My hobbies include reading books (mostly fantasy and sci-fi) and binge watching Netflix. I love dogs</p>
